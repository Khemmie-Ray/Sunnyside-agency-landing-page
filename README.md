## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flex

### What I learned
I learnt other styling options for the hamburger menu.

### Continued development

I intend to focus on the styling of the hamburger menu because it took a while before I understood how to achieve the background. Also the responsiveness of background images.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me with the learning of a mobile nav. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
